### About me

I am a game dev software engineer with over 20 years of experience writing code. I currently work for Rare Ltd, on Sea Of Thieves.

I don't have a huge amount of spare time to work on personal projects, but here are some are the bigger ones:

[WebNES](https://github.com/peteward44/WebNES) - My NES emulator for the browser written in Javascript. It was originally started over 10 years ago in 2013, and was one of the first retro emulators to use WebGL. Originally ported from my C++ NES emulator

[Nesulator](https://github.com/peteward44/nesulator) - My original C++ NES emulator

[Atlasbuilder](https://github.com/peteward44/atlasbuilder) - Texture atlas (spritesheet) builder. Takes numerous smaller images and tiles them efficiently into a power-of-two size texture, and outputs a JSON file containing meta information

[Texturebuilder](https://github.com/peteward44/texturebuilder) - Atlasbuilder in C#, with XML output (original project)

[Tetris-Pixi](https://github.com/peteward44/tetris-pixi) - Simple Tetris clone written in Javascript and Pixi.js

[My Oxygen Not Included Mods](https://github.com/peteward44/ONIMods) - Written in C#, a couple of mods for the Klei game [Oxygen Not Included](https://www.klei.com/games/oxygen-not-included)
