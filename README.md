### About me

I am a game dev software engineer with over 20 years of experience writing code. I currently work for Rare Ltd, on Sea Of Thieves.

I use this github as more of a dumping zone for any projects that may spring to mind, or that I have worked on over the years. It isn't really a curated list of amazing examples of my work as you might expect.

Still, the most popular project by far is [WebNes](https://github.com/peteward44/WebNES), my NES emulator for the browser written in Javascript. It was originally started over 10 years ago in 2013, and was one of the first retro emulators to use WebGL. It's a sort-of port of my original C++ project, [Nesulator](https://github.com/peteward44/nesulator).

Enjoy!
